All the contributions are welcome, however big or small. The intention is to open the process to anyone and everyone.

### Contribute your thoughts
Probably the easiest way to contribute is to open an issue [here](https://github.com/Staphylococcus/federal-eu-constitution/issues). This is a public forum, and all the ideas and questions are welcome.

Everyone is encouraged to open a pull request with their contribution to the body of the constitution. Probably not everything will get merged, but most pull requests will result in a conversation that will shape the thinking going forward.
