# TITLE I - Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

## Chapter I - General Principles

### Article I. 
No government body or actor shall enact, enforce, or tolerate policies, actions, or practices that directly or indirectly result in oppression, marginalization, or unfair treatment of any individual or group based on their ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, disability, or any other protected personal or social condition or circumstance explicitly recognized by this constitution. This includes failing to take reasonable and practicable steps to remedy instances of systemic or enduring actions or conditions that unjustly disadvantage an individual or group, or adopting measures that, without legitimate and proportionate justification, deny equality of opportunity or the protections guaranteed by law.

Government bodies shall take proactive measures to ensure that all citizens, irrespective of such personal or social conditions or circumstances, are equal before the law and enjoy the same rights and freedoms without discrimination, and in the event of conflict between the rights of different groups, steps shall be taken to resolve them in a way that respects the dignity and freedoms of all parties, while giving priority to the principle of non-prejudice and ensuring that no one's fundamental rights are subordinated to prejudicial or discriminatory practices on the part of others.

### Article II. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the fundamental freedoms of thought, conscience or expression, which are inalienable and guaranteed to everyone. This includes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any form of media, including digital platforms, without interference, censorship, or prior restraint by government or other authorities, regardless of frontiers.

However, restrictions may be imposed, but only where they are strictly necessary to protect legitimate interests and shall only be applied in specific circumstances and must be clearly justified, narrow, and proportional, with clear legal boundaries and judicial oversight to prevent abuse and ensure that they do not infringe upon the fundamental right to free expression.

These restrictions shall only be enforced to prevent the dissemination of classified or sensitive state information that could threaten national defense or harm international relations; demonstrably defamatory, libelous, or malicious speech that actually causes damage to reputation or dignity of individuals or groups, or contributes to harassment or prejudice; speech deemed inappropriate for minors might be restricted, but only in contexts where the restriction is genuinely necessary for protecting minors, without unduly limiting individual freedoms; or speech that infringes on a person's right to privacy, such as the unlawful dissemination of personal or private information without the consent of the person concerned. 

In addition, such restrictions shall never be used as a pretext to suppress political opposition, dissent, or criticism of the government; to weaken or compromise the functioning of a free and pluralistic democratic society; or to shield individuals who, based on credible, substantiated evidence reviewed by an impartial authority, are reasonably suspected of grave crimes, including but not limited to human trafficking, sexual exploitation, or significant corruption and under no circumstances shall the government or any authority suppress, silence, or penalize lawful speech based on its content or viewpoint, the freedom of speech shall not be abridged even during states of emergency, war, or national crises. 


### Article III. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the freedom of the press, which shall be guaranteed in all its forms, including print, broadcast, and digital media. Journalists shall have the right to access sources of information in accordance with the law. Such laws must be narrowly tailored, transparent, and fully comply with constitutional guarantees of press freedom, and must not be used to create undue barriers to journalistic work or access to public information.

Journalists shall be protected in the exercise of their professional duties, including investigative reporting, opinion writing, and whistleblowing, provided they act in good faith and in the public interest. The independence of the press and the confidentiality of journalistic sources shall be inviolable, except in cases where disclosure is clearly and narrowly necessary to prevent direct and immediate threat to the life, safety, or physical integrity of individuals, which cannot reasonably be prevented by any means other than the disclosure of confidential information, or to obtain evidence of serious criminal activity such as acts of terrorism, human trafficking or large-scale corruption, which threaten public safety, national security or the functioning of democratic institutions, and for which evidence of such activity is necessary for the exercise of justice. Disclosure may only occur under the review and approval of an independent and impartial judicial body, and affected journalists shall have the right to contest such decisions.

The government shall ensure a pluralistic media landscape free from undue concentration of ownership by establishing and enforcing clear regulatory frameworks. Such frameworks must be subject to independent oversight and shall include provisions for transparency in media ownership to prevent covert monopolies or excessive influence by any entity, public or private. Media outlets shall not face retaliatory actions, such as selective taxation, targeted licensing, or disproportionate penalties, for lawful reporting or criticism of the government.

### Article IV. 
No government body or actor shall, in any way other than those specified in this Constitution, prohibit the free exercise of any religion, and all individuals shall have the right to freedom of religion or belief. This right includes the freedom to hold, adopt, change, or renounce one’s religion or belief, as well as the freedom to manifest religion or belief through worship, practice, observance, and teaching, whether individually or in community with others, in public or private spaces. 

Individuals are guaranteed the right to establish, maintain, and access places of worship or assembly, to possess and use religious symbols and materials, and to observe religious practices, customs, and holidays without interference or discrimination. Restrictions on these rights shall only be permissible if their exercise presents a demonstrable, imminent, and substantial threat to public safety, public order, public health, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, and any such restriction shall be explicitly prescribed by law, clearly and narrowly defined to address the specific threat, and shall not be based on hypothetical, speculative, or generalized concerns. Such restrictions shall also be strictly necessary to address the identified threat and shall employ the least restrictive means available, without being applied in a discriminatory or disproportionate manner, and under no circumstances shall they unduly infringe upon the core essence of the right to freedom of religion or belief. In addition, in the interest of protecting children and ensuring that they develop their beliefs free from coercion or undue influence, the use of religious propaganda or the display of religious symbols that are excessively conspicuous shall be limited in settings where children are a captive audience, such as public schools, childcare facilities, or equivalent institutions. These limitations shall be applied equally to all religious or ideological expressions and be narrowly tailored to prevent exposure that could reasonably be perceived as coercive, while respecting individual freedoms to the greatest extent possible and more generally no person shall be subjected to coercion or pressure that compromises their freedom to choose, hold, or exercise their religion or belief, and this prohibition extends to all forms of force or manipulation by state actors, private entities, or individuals, including threats of penalty, denial of rights, or social or economic disadvantage, while under no circumstances shall any person, group, or institution invoke religious freedom as a pretext to infringe upon the rights, dignity, or equality of others.

The government, both federal and state, shall be religiously neutral, no government body, institution, or official, while acting in their official capacity or exercising the authority of the state, shall endorse, privilege, or promote any religion, belief, or non-belief as official or superior, nor shall they favor one over another, though this does not restrict government officials, as private citizens, from exercising their individual rights to express or practice their personal religion or belief, provided such expression does not create a reasonable perception of state endorsement or bias. The state shall maintain strict neutrality in matters of religion and belief, ensuring equal treatment and protection under the law for all, irrespective of religious or non-religious affiliation. 

### Article V. 
No government body or actor shall, in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the right to peaceful assembly and association. Every person has the fundamental right to peacefully assemble, associate, and express themselves, individually or collectively, without interference. This includes the right to form, join, and participate in organizations, political parties, trade unions, and other associations, as well as the right to take part in peaceful demonstrations, protests, strikes, and public gatherings.

The right to peaceful assembly and association shall be guaranteed, and no individual shall face reprisal, discrimination, or persecution for the peaceful exercise of these rights Assemblies and associations shall only be considered unlawful if they directly and intentionally involve violence, or pose a real and imminent threat to public safety, property, or the rights of others.

No individual shall be compelled to join, remain a member of, or participate in any association, organization, or political party against their will and no one shall be subjected to any form of retaliation, intimidation, or prosecution for participating in, organizing, or expressing views through peaceful assemblies or associations. Acts of discrimination, harassment, or unlawful detention related to the peaceful exercise of these rights shall be prohibited and subject to legal remedies and any regulation that unnecessarily limits or burdens the exercise of these rights shall be deemed void. 

Moreover, any restriction based on vague or overbroad criteria shall be considered unconstitutional and any such restriction shall be clearly established by law. It shall be specifically aimed at responding to a concrete and identifiable threat. The restriction shall be necessary to respond to the threat, and shall be implemented using the least intrusive measures possible. It shall be applied fairly and proportionately, without infringing any fundamental freedoms and any attempt to prevent, dissolve, or restrict peaceful gatherings or associations, based on political, ideological, religious, or ethnic grounds, or any other personal or social condition or circumstances protected by Article I, shall be prohibited.

### Article VI. 
No government body or actor shall make or enforce laws that fail to respect the human and civil rights described in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which must be guaranteed to all individuals, regardless of immutable characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, nationality or any other personal or social condition or circumstances protected by Article I.

### Article VII. 
No person shall be held in slavery or involuntary servitude. All forms of forced labor are strictly prohibited, and no government body, actor, or institution shall enact, authorize, or condone any laws, regulations, or actions that permit or facilitate slavery, servitude, or involuntary labor in any form. This includes any form of coercion, deception, or manipulation that compels an individual to perform work or services against their will. The only exception to this prohibition shall be for time-limited community service, which may be imposed as part of a criminal sanction, following a legal conviction and due process, and in accordance with the rights of the accused. Such community service shall not exceed a total of five hundred hours and shall not require the individual to work more than eight hours per day. The community service must adhere to local labor laws, ensuring that the work is non-degrading, non-coercive, and contributes positively to the community. 

Citizens and legal residents of this country shall have the fundamental right to freely choose their profession, occupation, and place of employment without fear of coercion, exploitation, or involuntary servitude. They also shall have the right to enter into and terminate employment contracts on terms that are mutually agreed upon and comply with applicable labor laws, ensuring that their employment is voluntary, fair, and based on mutual consent.

### Article VIII. 
Every individual possesses an inherent and inviolable right to dignity, which shall be respected, upheld, and protected at all times. This right is universal, applying to all persons without distinction of any kind, and guarantees the recognition of their intrinsic worth and humanity.

No government body, actor, official, or policy shall in any way undermine, violate, or compromise an individual’s dignity. All laws, policies, and actions undertaken by government bodies or officials shall be expressly required to safeguard and promote this right, ensuring that no act, decision, or omission infringes upon or diminishes the dignity of any person.

No individual shall be subjected to treatment or punishment that is degrading, humiliating, or grossly disproportionate to the nature and gravity of an offense. Inhumane punishments, including those that deliberately inflict extreme physical or mental suffering beyond what is necessary and lawful, are strictly prohibited. Practices such as torture, which entails the deliberate infliction of severe physical or psychological pain for the purposes of punishment, coercion, or intimidation, shall be strictly prohibited and excessive fines, meaning financial penalties disproportionate to the gravity of the offense or that impose undue hardship relative to an individual’s means, are likewise prohibited. 

### Article IX. 
Every citizen shall have the inalienable right to personal security, bodily integrity, and privacy, which shall not be violated by any government entity, authority, or agent, except as explicitly provided in this Article. 

No government entity shall conduct a search, surveillance, or seizure of any person, property, or communication that is unreasonable or disproportionate to the purpose it seeks to achieve. A search, seizure, or surveillance shall only be considered lawful if it is conducted pursuant to a specific warrant issued by a competent, impartial judicial authority, based on probable cause, and detailing with precision the location to be searched, the property or persons to be seized, and the evidence or items sought. 

The warrant must be obtained before any search or seizure takes place, except in cases where the individual, being considered legally responsible for their actions, gives informed, voluntary, and unequivocal consent to the search or seizure of their property or person. In exceptional circumstances where immediate action is necessary to prevent grave harm, a search or seizure may be carried out without a warrant, provided that there is probable cause to believe that such action is required to avert imminent danger to life or bodily harm, to prevent the destruction of evidence that is crucial to the investigation of a serious crime, or to prevent the escape of a person involved in such a crime. In these cases, the government actor conducting the search, seizure, or surveillance must ensure that the action taken is strictly limited in scope, duration, and intensity to what is necessary to address the immediate threat, and cease once the threat has been mitigated. Any action that goes beyond these limits or is conducted without proper justification shall be deemed unlawful, and the rights to personal security and privacy shall remain inviolate under this Article. 

### Article X. 
The personal data and communications of citizens shall be protected against arbitrary or unlawful interference by any public or private entity. 

No government body, actor, official, or private entity shall collect, store, or process personal data or communications without the explicit, informed, and voluntary consent of the individual concerned, which consent must be granted without coercion, manipulation, or undue influence, and shall be revocable at any time. 

The scope and purpose of data collection, storage, and processing shall be transparent, specific, and strictly limited to what is necessary for the fulfillment of legitimate purposes clearly defined by law. Any data retained must be accurate, up-to-date, and stored only for as long as necessary to achieve its purpose, after which it must be securely deleted or anonymized. Citizens shall have the right to access, correct, and request the deletion of their personal data at any time, and any data processing must be in full compliance with applicable data protection laws, ensuring accountability and oversight. 

To this extent no government body or actor shall access, intercept, or monitor the communications of any individual without lawful, proportionate, and necessary justification, subject to judicial oversight. Citizens shall have the right to request the erasure of their personal data from all databases held by public or private entities, in accordance with the principle of the right to be forgotten, except where retention is required by law for the investigation of serious criminal offenses. The processing of data in a manner contrary to these principles shall be prohibited, and any violation shall be subject to swift, effective remedies, including judicial review, to ensure the protection of individual privacy and data rights.

### Article XI. 
No citizen shall be arbitrarily expelled from the territory of the state, deported, or deprived of their nationality under any circumstances. Citizenship is an inherent and inalienable right that shall not be revoked except in cases of proven fraud in its acquisition, and only after due process of law has been fully observed, including the right to a fair hearing, legal representation, and appeal.

Every citizen has the unconditional right to reside within the territory of their home country. No individual shall be forcibly removed, exiled, or compelled to leave their country except in cases involving lawful extradition procedures based on international agreements and following the principles of transparency, fairness, and necessity.

The removal of a citizen from their home country, where legally permissible, must be carried out strictly in accordance with a court order issued after exhaustive judicial review. Such procedures must ensure the protection of fundamental rights, including the individual’s access to legal remedies, protection against statelessness, and preservation of family unity. Decisions that violate these principles shall be null and void.

Any government action seeking to expel, deport, or revoke the nationality of a citizen must be justified by clear, specific, and verifiable evidence. The burden of proof shall rest entirely on the state, and the individual concerned must have the opportunity to challenge the decision in a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal.

### Article XII. 
Every citizen is entitled to an inalienable and unqualified right to move freely and unhindered within the national territory. This right includes traveling, residing, and settling in any region of the country without interference. Internal movement shall not be contingent upon permits, surveillance, checkpoints, or other administrative barriers unless explicitly authorized by a narrowly tailored law. Such a law must address exceptional circumstances where restrictions are demonstrably necessary to protect public health during an officially declared emergency, respond to a specific and immediate national security threat, or prevent a concrete and imminent criminal act with direct evidence supporting the restriction. Laws governing such limitations must precisely define their scope, justify their necessity, and stipulate the conditions under which they apply.

Citizens can freely choose their place of residence within the national territory. This right encompasses the ability to purchase, lease, or otherwise occupy property in any region, city, or locality, subject only to non-discriminatory property and zoning regulations that serve a legitimate and neutral purpose. Any attempt to prevent, deny, or revoke the exercise of this right must be clearly grounded in law and must not favor or disadvantage individuals for discriminatory reasons.

The right of every citizen to leave the country and return at any time is absolute and shall not be curtailed except under clearly defined circumstances established by law. Restrictions may only arise in cases where national security faces an immediate and demonstrable risk, where a declared public health emergency necessitates such measures, or where an individual is subject to an enforceable judicial order related to ongoing criminal investigations or proceedings. Any restriction on exit or re-entry must be substantiated with a written justification specifying the lawful basis, and the affected individual shall have immediate access to judicial review. 

Citizens cannot be arbitrarily exiled, deported, or denied the ability to return to their own country under any circumstances.

The unlawful restriction of movement, residence, or travel by any person or authority constitutes a serious violation of fundamental rights. Such actions shall render the offending parties liable under both civil and criminal law, with victims entitled to timely redress. 

### Article XIII. 
Everyone has the right to acquire, own, use, and dispose of private property, either individually or in association with others; this right is protected and inviolable, except where restricted by law for public necessity, utility, or social equity, and only in return for just and adequate compensation; The right of inheritance is guaranteed.

### Article XIV. 
The death penalty shall be abolished, no individual shall be subjected to capital punishment under any circumstances; life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after twenty years or less constitutes the maximum penalty for criminal offenses, in accordance with the principles of human dignity and justice defined in Article VIII.

### Article XV. 
No government body, actor, official, or private entity shall discriminate against citizens of other states in favor of its own citizens with respect to basic privileges, freedoms and immunities. These privileges, freedoms and immunities include the protection of the government, the enjoyment of life and liberty, the right of a citizen of one state to pass through or reside in another state for commercial, agricultural, professional or other purposes, to claim the benefit of habeas corpus, to institute and prosecute legal proceedings in the courts of the state, to own, hold and dispose of property and to be exempt from taxes or duties higher than those paid by other citizens of the state.

All foreigners legally present in the country enjoy the protection of the law in respect of their person and property.

### Article XVI. 
No one shall be extradited except by virtue of a duly ratified international convention.

### Article XVII. 
No government body or actor shall impose any special taxes on emigration from a State or from the Federation, but unrealized gains may be considered realized for tax purposes if the asset is also emigrating.

### Article XVIII. 
Children shall be protected from all forms of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, and harmful practices. Governments at all levels shall take effective measures to prevent child labor, trafficking, and any other forms of exploitation that may harm a child’s physical or mental well-being.

### Article XIX. 
Every citizen has the right to access information held by public authorities, subject only to lawful restrictions necessary for the protection of national security, public order, privacy, or other legitimate interests. Public authorities shall ensure transparency by providing information in an open, timely, and accessible manner, and citizens are entitled to request clear, accurate, and complete responses. The right to access includes the reasoning behind decisions that affect individuals or the public. Any denial of information must be justified by law, and citizens may challenge such refusals before an independent body or court, which shall have the authority to make binding decisions.

### Article XX. 
No governmental body or actor shall enact or enforce laws which prevent two persons from marrying, discriminate the value of this union or founding a family on such pretexts as sexual orientation or other personal or social conditions or circumstances described in this constitution, or from contracting a marriage without the free and full consent of both parties, having reached the legal age of consent, and no third party whatsoever shall oppose the marriage of two consenting adults.
