# TITLE I - Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

## Chapter I - General Principles

### Article I. 
No government body or actor shall enact, enforce, or tolerate policies, actions, or practices that directly or indirectly result in oppression, marginalization, or unfair treatment of any individual or group based on their ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, disability, or any other protected personal or social condition or circumstance explicitly recognized by this constitution. This includes failing to take reasonable and practicable steps to remedy instances of systemic or enduring actions or conditions that unjustly disadvantage an individual or group, or adopting measures that, without legitimate and proportionate justification, deny equality of opportunity or the protections guaranteed by law.

Government bodies shall take proactive measures to ensure that all citizens, irrespective of such personal or social conditions or circumstances, are equal before the law and enjoy the same rights and freedoms without discrimination, and in the event of conflict between the rights of different groups, steps shall be taken to resolve them in a way that respects the dignity and freedoms of all parties, while giving priority to the principle of non-prejudice and ensuring that no one's fundamental rights are subordinated to prejudicial or discriminatory practices on the part of others.

### Article II. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the fundamental freedoms of thought, conscience, press, or expression, which are inalienable and guaranteed to all citizens. This includes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any form of media, including digital platforms, without interference, censorship, or prior restraint by government or other authorities, regardless of frontiers.

However, restrictions may be imposed, but only where they are strictly necessary to protect legitimate interests and shall only be applied in specific circumstances and must be clearly justified, narrow, and proportional, with clear legal boundaries and judicial oversight to prevent abuse and ensure that they do not infringe upon the fundamental right to free expression. These restrictions shall only be enforced to prevent the dissemination of classified or sensitive state information that could threaten national defense or harm international relations; defamatory, libelous, or malicious speech that damages the reputation or dignity of individuals or groups, or contributes to harassment or prejudice; speech deemed inappropriate for minors may be restricted, but only in contexts where the restriction is genuinely necessary for protecting minors, without unduly limiting individual freedoms; or speech that infringes privacy, such as the unlawful dissemination of personal or private information without the consent of the person concerned. 

### Article III. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the freedom of the press, which shall be guaranteed in all its forms, including print, broadcast, and digital media. Journalists shall have the right to access sources of information in accordance with the law. Such laws must be narrowly tailored, transparent, and fully comply with constitutional guarantees of press freedom, and must not be used to create undue barriers to journalistic work or access to public information.

Journalists shall be protected in the exercise of their professional duties, including investigative reporting, opinion writing, and whistleblowing, provided they act in good faith and in the public interest. The independence of the press and the confidentiality of journalistic sources shall be inviolable, except in cases where disclosure is clearly and narrowly necessary to prevent direct and immediate threat to the life, safety, or physical integrity of individuals, which cannot reasonably be prevented by any means other than the disclosure of confidential information, or to obtain evidence of serious criminal activity such as acts of terrorism, human trafficking or large-scale corruption, which threaten public safety, national security or the functioning of democratic institutions, and for which evidence of such activity is necessary for the exercise of justice. Disclosure may only occur under the review and approval of an independent and impartial judicial body, and affected journalists shall have the right to contest such decisions.

The government shall ensure a pluralistic media landscape free from undue concentration of ownership by establishing and enforcing clear regulatory frameworks. Such frameworks must be subject to independent oversight and shall include provisions for transparency in media ownership to prevent covert monopolies or excessive influence by any entity, public or private. Media outlets shall not face retaliatory actions, such as selective taxation, targeted licensing, or disproportionate penalties, for lawful reporting or criticism of the government.

The government shall publish an annual report detailing actions taken to regulate the media landscape, including any restrictions applied, with clear justifications and an assessment of their proportionality and necessity. This report shall be reviewed by an independent oversight body to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Article IV. 
No government body or actor shall  in any way prohibit the free exercise of any religion, all individuals shall have the right to freedom of religion or belief. This includes the freedom to change one's religion or belief and the freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, practice, observance, and teaching, either individually or in community with others, in public or private spaces.

### Article V. 
No government body or actor shall, in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the right to peaceful assembly and association. Every person has the fundamental right to peacefully assemble, associate, and express themselves, individually or collectively, without interference. This includes the right to form, join, and participate in organizations, political parties, trade unions, and other associations, as well as the right to take part in peaceful demonstrations, protests, strikes, and public gatherings.

The right to peaceful assembly and association shall be guaranteed, and no individual shall face reprisal, discrimination, or persecution for the peaceful exercise of these rights Assemblies and associations shall only be considered unlawful if they directly and intentionally involve violence, or pose a real and imminent threat to public safety, property, or the rights of others.

No individual shall be compelled to join, remain a member of, or participate in any association, organization, or political party against their will and no one shall be subjected to any form of retaliation, intimidation, or prosecution for participating in, organizing, or expressing views through peaceful assemblies or associations. Acts of discrimination, harassment, or unlawful detention related to the peaceful exercise of these rights shall be prohibited and subject to legal remedies and any regulation that unnecessarily limits or burdens the exercise of these rights shall be deemed void. 

Moreover, any restriction based on vague or overbroad criteria shall be considered unconstitutional and any such restriction shall be clearly established by law. It shall be specifically aimed at responding to a concrete and identifiable threat. The restriction shall be necessary to respond to the threat, and shall be implemented using the least intrusive measures possible. It shall be applied fairly and proportionately, without infringing any fundamental freedoms and any attempt to prevent, dissolve, or restrict peaceful gatherings or associations, based on political, ideological, religious, or ethnic grounds, or any other personal or social condition or circumstances protected by Article I, shall be prohibited.

### Article VI.

### Article VII. 
No one shall be held in slavery or involuntary servitude. All forms of forced labor shall be prohibited, and no government body or actor shall legislate in any way to authorize them, with the exception of time-limited community service, which shall not exceed five hundred hours with a daily maximum of eight hours, in accordance with local labor laws, as part of a criminal sanction where the accused has been legally convicted.
