# TITLE I - Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

## Chapter I - General Principles

### Article I. 
No government body or actor shall enact, enforce, or tolerate policies, actions, or practices that directly or indirectly result in oppression, marginalization, or unfair treatment of any individual or group based on their ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, disability, or any other protected personal or social condition or circumstance explicitly recognized by this constitution. This includes failing to take reasonable and practicable steps to remedy instances of systemic or enduring actions or conditions that unjustly disadvantage an individual or group, or adopting measures that, without legitimate and proportionate justification, deny equality of opportunity or the protections guaranteed by law.

Government bodies shall take proactive measures to ensure that all citizens, irrespective of such personal or social conditions or circumstances, are equal before the law and enjoy the same rights and freedoms without discrimination, and in the event of conflict between the rights of different groups, steps shall be taken to resolve them in a way that respects the dignity and freedoms of all parties, while giving priority to the principle of non-prejudice and ensuring that no one's fundamental rights are subordinated to prejudicial or discriminatory practices on the part of others.

### Article II. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the fundamental freedoms of thought, conscience, press, or expression, which are inalienable and guaranteed to all citizens. This includes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any form of media, including digital platforms, without interference, censorship, or prior restraint by government or other authorities, regardless of frontiers.

However, restrictions may be imposed, but only where they are strictly necessary to protect legitimate interests and shall only be applied in specific circumstances and must be clearly justified, narrow, and proportional, with clear legal boundaries and judicial oversight to prevent abuse and ensure that they do not infringe upon the fundamental right to free expression. These restrictions shall only be enforced to prevent the dissemination of classified or sensitive state information that could threaten national defense or harm international relations; defamatory, libelous, or malicious speech that damages the reputation or dignity of individuals or groups, or contributes to harassment or prejudice; speech deemed inappropriate for minors may be restricted, but only in contexts where the restriction is genuinely necessary for protecting minors, without unduly limiting individual freedoms; or speech that infringes privacy, such as the unlawful dissemination of personal or private information without the consent of the person concerned. 

### Article III. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the freedom of the press, which shall be guaranteed in all its forms, including print, broadcast, and digital media. Journalists shall have the right to access sources of information in accordance with the law. Such laws must be narrowly tailored, transparent, and fully comply with constitutional guarantees of press freedom, and must not be used to create undue barriers to journalistic work or access to public information.

Journalists shall be protected in the exercise of their professional duties, including investigative reporting, opinion writing, and whistleblowing, provided they act in good faith and in the public interest. The independence of the press and the confidentiality of journalistic sources shall be inviolable, except in cases where disclosure is clearly and narrowly necessary to prevent direct and immediate threat to the life, safety, or physical integrity of individuals, which cannot reasonably be prevented by any means other than the disclosure of confidential information, or to obtain evidence of serious criminal activity such as acts of terrorism, human trafficking or large-scale corruption, which threaten public safety, national security or the functioning of democratic institutions, and for which evidence of such activity is necessary for the exercise of justice. Disclosure may only occur under the review and approval of an independent and impartial judicial body, and affected journalists shall have the right to contest such decisions.

The government shall ensure a pluralistic media landscape free from undue concentration of ownership by establishing and enforcing clear regulatory frameworks. Such frameworks must be subject to independent oversight and shall include provisions for transparency in media ownership to prevent covert monopolies or excessive influence by any entity, public or private. Media outlets shall not face retaliatory actions, such as selective taxation, targeted licensing, or disproportionate penalties, for lawful reporting or criticism of the government.

The government shall publish an annual report detailing actions taken to regulate the media landscape, including any restrictions applied, with clear justifications and an assessment of their proportionality and necessity. This report shall be reviewed by an independent oversight body to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Article IV. 
No government body or actor shall  in any way prohibit the free exercise of any religion, all individuals shall have the right to freedom of religion or belief. This includes the freedom to change one's religion or belief and the freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, practice, observance, and teaching, either individually or in community with others, in public or private spaces.

### Article V. 
No government body or actor shall restrict in any way the right of peaceful assembly and association. This includes the right to form and join associations, organizations and political parties, as well as the right to take part in peaceful demonstrations, strikes and protests, without fear of reprisal or persecution, in accordance with the law.

### Article VI. 
No government body or actor shall make or enforce laws that fail to respect the human and civil rights described in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which must be guaranteed to all individuals, regardless of immutable characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, nationality or any other personal condition.

### Article VII. 
No person shall be held in slavery or involuntary servitude. All forms of forced labor are strictly prohibited, and no government body, actor, or institution shall enact, authorize, or condone any laws, regulations, or actions that permit or facilitate slavery, servitude, or involuntary labor in any form. This includes any form of coercion, deception, or manipulation that compels an individual to perform work or services against their will. The only exception to this prohibition shall be for time-limited community service, which may be imposed as part of a criminal sanction, following a legal conviction and due process, and in accordance with the rights of the accused. Such community service shall not exceed a total of five hundred hours and shall not require the individual to work more than eight hours per day. The community service must adhere to local labor laws, ensuring that the work is non-degrading, non-coercive, and contributes positively to the community. Citizens and legal residents of this country have the fundamental right to freely choose their profession, occupation, and place of employment without fear of coercion, exploitation, or involuntary servitude. They also have the right to enter into and terminate employment contracts on terms that are mutually agreed upon and comply with applicable labor laws, ensuring that their employment is voluntary, fair, and based on mutual consent.

### Article VIII. 
Everyone has an inherent right to dignity. All laws, all government bodies and actors, and all policies shall respect people's dignity and prohibit degrading treatment. No individual should be subjected to excessive fines or inhumane punishments such as torture.

### Article IX. 
Every citizen has the right to personal security and privacy. No government body or actor shall infringe on these rights. Unreasonable search, surveillance or seizure of property or persons shall be prohibited without a specific warrant describing precisely what is to be searched, monitored or seized, issued by a competent judicial authority. In addition, the only searches that shall be considered lawful and  reasonable without the need for a warrant are those supported by the consent of the legal owner, over eighteen years of age, of the property surveyed, seized or searched or those carried out in an emergency supported by probable cause and limited by law, when a person is in danger of death, assault or serious injury or when incriminating evidence of a serious crime is in danger of being destroyed.

### Article X. 
Citizens’ personal data and communications are protected against arbitrary interference. Data can only be collected, stored, and processed with the individual’s consent and in accordance with the law. The right to be forgotten is guaranteed.

### Article XI. 
No citizen shall be expelled, deported, or deprived of their nationality arbitrarily. Every citizen has the right to remain in their home country, and any removal must follow due process and the law.

### Article XII. 
Every individual has the right to move freely within the country, choose their place of residence, and leave and return at any time. Restrictions on movement must be lawful, proportionate, non-discriminatory, and subject to judicial review.

### Article XIII. 
Everyone has the right to acquire, own, use, and dispose of private property, either individually or in association with others. This right is protected and inviolable, except where restricted by law for public necessity, utility, or social equity, and only in return for just and adequate compensation. The right of inheritance is guaranteed.

### Article XIV. 
The death penalty shall be abolished. No individual may be subjected to capital punishment under any circumstances. Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years or less constitutes the maximum penalty for criminal offenses, in accordance with the principles of human dignity and justice defined in Article VIII.

### Article XVIII. 
Children shall be protected from all forms of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, and harmful practices. Governments at all levels shall take effective measures to prevent child labor, trafficking, and any other forms of exploitation that may harm a child’s physical or mental well-being.

### Article XIX. 
Every citizen has the right to access information held by public authorities, subject only to lawful restrictions necessary for the protection of national security, public order, privacy, or other legitimate interests. Public authorities shall ensure transparency by providing information in an open, timely, and accessible manner, and citizens are entitled to request clear, accurate, and complete responses. The right to access includes the reasoning behind decisions that affect individuals or the public. Any denial of information must be justified by law, and citizens may challenge such refusals before an independent body or court, which shall have the authority to make binding decisions.

### Article XX. 
No governmental body or actor shall enact or enforce laws which prevent two persons from marrying, discriminate the value of this union or founding a family on such pretexts as sexual orientation or other personal or social conditions or circumstances described in this constitution, or from contracting a marriage without the free and full consent of both parties, having reached the legal age of consent, and no third party whatsoever shall oppose the marriage of two consenting adults.
