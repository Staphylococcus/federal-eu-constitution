# TITLE I - Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

## Chapter I - General Principles

### Article I. 
No government body or actor shall enact, enforce, or tolerate policies, actions, or practices that directly or indirectly result in oppression, marginalization, or unfair treatment of any individual or group based on their ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, disability, or any other protected personal or social condition or circumstance explicitly recognized by this constitution. This includes failing to take reasonable and practicable steps to remedy instances of systemic or enduring actions or conditions that unjustly disadvantage an individual or group, or adopting measures that, without legitimate and proportionate justification, deny equality of opportunity or the protections guaranteed by law.

Government bodies shall take proactive measures to ensure that all citizens, irrespective of such personal or social conditions or circumstances, are equal before the law and enjoy the same rights and freedoms without discrimination, and in the event of conflict between the rights of different groups, steps shall be taken to resolve them in a way that respects the dignity and freedoms of all parties, while giving priority to the principle of non-prejudice and ensuring that no one's fundamental rights are subordinated to prejudicial or discriminatory practices on the part of others.

### Article II. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the fundamental freedoms of thought, conscience, press, or expression, which are inalienable and guaranteed to all citizens. This includes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any form of media, including digital platforms, without interference, censorship, or prior restraint by government or other authorities, regardless of frontiers.

However, restrictions may be imposed, but only where they are strictly necessary to protect legitimate interests and shall only be applied in specific circumstances and must be clearly justified, narrow, and proportional, with clear legal boundaries and judicial oversight to prevent abuse and ensure that they do not infringe upon the fundamental right to free expression. These restrictions shall only be enforced to prevent the dissemination of classified or sensitive state information that could threaten national defense or harm international relations; defamatory, libelous, or malicious speech that damages the reputation or dignity of individuals or groups, or contributes to harassment or prejudice; speech deemed inappropriate for minors may be restricted, but only in contexts where the restriction is genuinely necessary for protecting minors, without unduly limiting individual freedoms; or speech that infringes privacy, such as the unlawful dissemination of personal or private information without the consent of the person concerned. 

### Article III. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the freedom of the press, which shall be guaranteed in all its forms, including print, broadcast, and digital media. Journalists shall have the right to access sources of information in accordance with the law. Such laws must be narrowly tailored, transparent, and fully comply with constitutional guarantees of press freedom, and must not be used to create undue barriers to journalistic work or access to public information.

Journalists shall be protected in the exercise of their professional duties, including investigative reporting, opinion writing, and whistleblowing, provided they act in good faith and in the public interest. The independence of the press and the confidentiality of journalistic sources shall be inviolable, except in cases where disclosure is clearly and narrowly necessary to prevent direct and immediate threat to the life, safety, or physical integrity of individuals, which cannot reasonably be prevented by any means other than the disclosure of confidential information, or to obtain evidence of serious criminal activity such as acts of terrorism, human trafficking or large-scale corruption, which threaten public safety, national security or the functioning of democratic institutions, and for which evidence of such activity is necessary for the exercise of justice. Disclosure may only occur under the review and approval of an independent and impartial judicial body, and affected journalists shall have the right to contest such decisions.

The government shall ensure a pluralistic media landscape free from undue concentration of ownership by establishing and enforcing clear regulatory frameworks. Such frameworks must be subject to independent oversight and shall include provisions for transparency in media ownership to prevent covert monopolies or excessive influence by any entity, public or private. Media outlets shall not face retaliatory actions, such as selective taxation, targeted licensing, or disproportionate penalties, for lawful reporting or criticism of the government.

The government shall publish an annual report detailing actions taken to regulate the media landscape, including any restrictions applied, with clear justifications and an assessment of their proportionality and necessity. This report shall be reviewed by an independent oversight body to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Article IV. 
No government body or actor shall, in any way other than those specified in this Constitution, prohibit the free exercise of any religion, and all individuals shall have the right to freedom of religion or belief. This right includes the freedom to hold, adopt, change, or renounce oneâ€™s religion or belief, as well as the freedom to manifest religion or belief through worship, practice, observance, and teaching, whether individually or in community with others, in public or private spaces. 

Individuals are guaranteed the right to establish, maintain, and access places of worship or assembly, to possess and use religious symbols and materials, and to observe religious practices, customs, and holidays without interference or discrimination. Restrictions on these rights shall only be permissible if their exercise presents a demonstrable, imminent, and substantial threat to public safety, public order, public health, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, and any such restriction shall be explicitly prescribed by law, clearly and narrowly defined to address the specific threat, and shall not be based on hypothetical, speculative, or generalized concerns. Such restrictions shall also be strictly necessary to address the identified threat and shall employ the least restrictive means available, without being applied in a discriminatory or disproportionate manner, and under no circumstances shall they unduly infringe upon the core essence of the right to freedom of religion or belief. In addition, in the interest of protecting children and ensuring that they develop their beliefs free from coercion or undue influence, the use of religious propaganda or the display of religious symbols that are excessively conspicuous shall be limited in settings where children are a captive audience, such as public schools, childcare facilities, or equivalent institutions. These limitations shall be applied equally to all religious or ideological expressions and be narrowly tailored to prevent exposure that could reasonably be perceived as coercive, while respecting individual freedoms to the greatest extent possible and more generally no person shall be subjected to coercion or pressure that compromises their freedom to choose, hold, or exercise their religion or belief, and this prohibition extends to all forms of force or manipulation by state actors, private entities, or individuals, including threats of penalty, denial of rights, or social or economic disadvantage, while under no circumstances shall any person, group, or institution invoke religious freedom as a pretext to infringe upon the rights, dignity, or equality of others.

The government, both federal and state, shall be religiously neutral, no government body, institution, or official, while acting in their official capacity or exercising the authority of the state, shall endorse, privilege, or promote any religion, belief, or non-belief as official or superior, nor shall they favor one over another, though this does not restrict government officials, as private citizens, from exercising their individual rights to express or practice their personal religion or belief, provided such expression does not create a reasonable perception of state endorsement or bias. The state shall maintain strict neutrality in matters of religion and belief, ensuring equal treatment and protection under the law for all, irrespective of religious or non-religious affiliation. 

### Article V. 
No government body or actor shall, in any way other than those specified in this constitution, restrict the right to peaceful assembly and association. Every person has the fundamental right to peacefully assemble, associate, and express themselves, individually or collectively, without interference. This includes the right to form, join, and participate in organizations, political parties, trade unions, and other associations, as well as the right to take part in peaceful demonstrations, protests, strikes, and public gatherings.

The right to peaceful assembly and association shall be guaranteed, and no individual shall face reprisal, discrimination, or persecution for the peaceful exercise of these rights Assemblies and associations shall only be considered unlawful if they directly and intentionally involve violence, or pose a real and imminent threat to public safety, property, or the rights of others.

No individual shall be compelled to join, remain a member of, or participate in any association, organization, or political party against their will and no one shall be subjected to any form of retaliation, intimidation, or prosecution for participating in, organizing, or expressing views through peaceful assemblies or associations. Acts of discrimination, harassment, or unlawful detention related to the peaceful exercise of these rights shall be prohibited and subject to legal remedies and any regulation that unnecessarily limits or burdens the exercise of these rights shall be deemed void. 

Moreover, any restriction based on vague or overbroad criteria shall be considered unconstitutional and any such restriction shall be clearly established by law. It shall be specifically aimed at responding to a concrete and identifiable threat. The restriction shall be necessary to respond to the threat, and shall be implemented using the least intrusive measures possible. It shall be applied fairly and proportionately, without infringing any fundamental freedoms and any attempt to prevent, dissolve, or restrict peaceful gatherings or associations, based on political, ideological, religious, or ethnic grounds, or any other personal or social condition or circumstances protected by Article I, shall be prohibited.

### Article VI. 
No government body or actor shall make or enforce laws that fail to respect the human and civil rights described in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which must be guaranteed to all individuals, regardless of immutable characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, nationality or any other personal or social condition or circumstances protected by Article I.

### Article VII. 
No one shall be held in slavery or involuntary servitude. All forms of forced labor shall be prohibited, and no government body or actor shall legislate in any way to authorize them, with the exception of time-limited community service, which shall not exceed five hundred hours with a daily maximum of eight hours, in accordance with local labor laws, as part of a criminal sanction where the accused has been legally convicted. Citizens and legal residents have the right to freely choose their profession and enter into employment contracts.

### Article VIII. 
Everyone has an inherent right to dignity. All laws, all government bodies and actors, and all policies shall respect people's dignity and prohibit degrading treatment. No individual should be subjected to excessive fines or inhumane punishments such as torture.

### Article IX. 
Every citizen has the right to personal security and privacy. No government body or actor shall infringe on these rights. Unreasonable search, surveillance or seizure of property or persons shall be prohibited without a specific warrant describing precisely what is to be searched, monitored or seized, issued by a competent judicial authority. In addition, the only searches that shall be considered lawful and  reasonable without the need for a warrant are those supported by the consent of the legal owner, over eighteen years of age, of the property surveyed, seized or searched or those carried out in an emergency supported by probable cause and limited by law, when a person is in danger of death, assault or serious injury or when incriminating evidence of a serious crime is in danger of being destroyed.

### Article X. 
Citizensâ€™ personal data and communications are protected against arbitrary interference. Data can only be collected, stored, and processed with the individualâ€™s consent and in accordance with the law. The right to be forgotten is guaranteed.

### Article XI. 
No citizen shall be expelled, deported, or deprived of their nationality arbitrarily. Every citizen has the right to remain in their home country, and any removal must follow due process and the law.

### Article XII. 
Every individual has the right to move freely within the country, choose their place of residence, and leave and return at any time. Restrictions on movement must be lawful, proportionate, non-discriminatory, and subject to judicial review.

### Article XIII. 
Everyone has the right to acquire, own, use, and dispose of private property, either individually or in association with others. This right is protected and inviolable, except where restricted by law for public necessity, utility, or social equity, and only in return for just and adequate compensation. The right of inheritance is guaranteed.

### Article XIV. 
The death penalty shall be abolished. No individual may be subjected to capital punishment under any circumstances. Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years or less constitutes the maximum penalty for criminal offenses, in accordance with the principles of human dignity and justice defined in Article VIII.

### Article XV. 
All foreigners legally present in the country enjoy the protection of the law in respect of their person and property.

### Article XVI. 
No one may be extradited except by virtue of a duly ratified international convention.

### Article XVII. 
Under no circumstances may a political refugee legally entitled to asylum be handed over or extradited.

### Article XVIII. 
Children shall be protected from all forms of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, and harmful practices. Governments at all levels shall take effective measures to prevent child labor, trafficking, and any other forms of exploitation that may harm a childâ€™s physical or mental well-being.

### Article XIX. 
Every citizen has the right to access information held by public authorities, subject only to lawful restrictions necessary for the protection of national security, public order, privacy, or other legitimate interests. Public authorities shall ensure transparency by providing information in an open, timely, and accessible manner, and citizens are entitled to request clear, accurate, and complete responses. The right to access includes the reasoning behind decisions that affect individuals or the public. Any denial of information must be justified by law, and citizens may challenge such refusals before an independent body or court, which shall have the authority to make binding decisions.

### Article XX. 
No governmental body or actor shall enact or enforce laws which prevent two persons from marrying, discriminate the value of this union or founding a family on such pretexts as sexual orientation or other personal or social conditions or circumstances described in this constitution, or from contracting a marriage without the free and full consent of both parties, having reached the legal age of consent, and no third party whatsoever shall oppose the marriage of two consenting adults.
